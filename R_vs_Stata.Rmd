## R vs Stata

## From Stata to R

## Why R?

---
## R vs Stata

### .f4[Differences]

* R is object oriented while Stata is action oriented:
  + Classic example: Stata's `summarize` vs R's `summary()`
  
  + In Stata you declare what you want to do, while in R you usually declare the result you want to get

--

* R needs to load non-base commands (packages) at the beginning of each session
  
  + Imagine that in Stata you'd have to load a command installed with `ssc install` every time you'll use it in a new session
  
  + There is a way to bypass this

---
## R vs Stata

### .f4[Differences]

* R is less specialized:
--
more flexibility and more functionalities.

--

* R has a much broader network of users:

  + More resources online, which makes using Google a lot easier. You'll never want to see Statalist again in your life!
  
  + Development of new features and bug fixes happen faster.


---
### Advantages of Stata

- Stata is more specialized:
--
Some common but complex tasks are simpler

--

- Stata has wider adoption among micro-econometricians (though R adoption is steadily increasing). 

--

- The implementation of frames in Stata 16 has made everything easier

--

- Super intuitive

--

- It is getting better and better with each upgrade

???
Running a regression with clustered standard errors
Analyzing survey data with weights

Network externalities in your work environment.
Development of new specialized techniques and tools could happen faster (e.g. ietoolkit).

---
## Advantages of R

- R is a free and open source software!

--

- It allows you to have several datasets open simultaneously.
    + No need to use `keep`, `preserve`, `restore`, or `tempfile` 
--

- It can run complex Geographic Information System (GIS) analyses.

--

- You can use it for web scrapping.

--

- You can run machine learning algorithms with it

---
## Advantages of R

- You can create complex Markdown documents. This presentation, for example, is entirely done in R.
    - Latex, slides, websites, books, reports, Word documents, PPT presentations, etc.

--

- It reads and works with no rectangular data

--

- You can create interactive dashboards and online applications with the Shiny package.

---
## Advantages of R

- Help online is amazing!

--

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) exists
    + Everything is integrated. The interface, the data, the code, git, and the outcome.
--

- R is constantly updated and fixed.

---
## R vs Python

.center[.f3[.light-red[Disclaimer: ]I don't know enough about Python to make a fair assessment]]

---
## R vs Python

### .f4[In general]

- Python and R were created with different objectives.

  + Python was created as a general programming language
  
  + R was created for statistical analysis

--

- Over time both have moved slowly to the each other's side.

--

- You can find a "fair" comparison in this [PDF created by DataCamp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/email/other/Python+vs+R.pdf). 

--

   + .orange[I say "fair" because it is too general, and not specific for economists and social scientists.] 

---
## R vs Python

- I Prefer R because it is designed for and by academics, not developers.

--

- If there is something that I need to do in Python, I just run Python from R, get the results, and keep working on R
--
(same thing with Stata). 

--

- Contrary to what some people say, I think R syntax is easier than Python's.

--

- Coding with `tidyverse` or `data.table` syntax make the work extremely easy.

---
## R vs Python

- The whole `tidyverse` and RStudio tools are just amazing. There is nothing like that in Python!

--

- You should learn both! 

---
## ... BUT!

If I were going to teach my kids one programming language, it will Python.

---

## Well, because...

--

- If R keeps getting more popularity than R, it will be more attractive in their CVs. 

--

- It is a general programming language that allows them to create anything from scratch; not only useful for data analysis.

--

- I will teach them R, anyway...

## Everything you need to start working with R

## Installation

You need R and RStudio installed in your computer:

### Instructions

* Please visit (https://cran.r-project.org) and select a Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) mirror close to you.

* To install RStudio, go to (https://www.rstudio.com/). .red[You need to install R first.]

## Data in R

---

### In Stata:

* You can open __one dataset__ and perform operations that can change that dataset.

* You can also have other things, such as matrices, macros and tempfiles, but they are secondary. __Most functions only use the main dataset__.

* If you wish to do any non-permanent changes to your data, __you'll need to preserve the original data to keep it intact__.

---

### In R:

__R__ works in a completely different way: 
 
* You can load __as many datasets as you wish__ or your computer's memory allows

* Operations will have lasting effects __only if you store them__

---

### In R:

* Everything that exists in R's memory -- variables, datasets, functions -- __is an object__

--

* You could think of an object like a chunk of data with some properties that has a name by which you call it

--

* If you create an object, it's going to be stored in memory until you delete it or quit R

--

* Whenever you run anything you intend to use in the future, __you need to store it as an object__.
